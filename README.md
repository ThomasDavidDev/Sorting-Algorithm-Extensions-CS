# Sorting Algorithm Extensions for CS

Hey,
For school I had to implemented some basic sorting algorithms in C #. I made some extensions for List<>.

* Heap Sort
* AVLtree Sort
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort

It's possible that OrderBy and OrderByDescending are reversed. 

**Usage:**
ex: list = list.OrderByHeapSort(x => x).ToList();

Note: Feel free to comment and/ or adjust bugs or suggest extra functions And remember, respect the GPL2 license.

When something is useful, give it a star!
